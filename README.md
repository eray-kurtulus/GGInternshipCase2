This is a case project I did for an internship application. Here are the details of the project:


Gulliver's Games Case Project 

//WHAT YOU HAVE//

What you have is a UI/screen that players open and they can unlock new skins that they use in the game.
You'll find the sprites in the project as well.


//WHAT WE NEED//

When player clicks unlock button, mechanic (green frame) should randomly move on different skins.
Here is the video of how that movement look like: https://youtu.be/ePEnJXnV6rY?t=247

When green frame stops on a specific skin, that will be unlocked and player will see what that is.

Players can unlock skins one by one (in the same play mode) without any problem until there will be no locked skin.


//WHAT WE EXPECT//

To see the above mechanic works in a good looking way; both for users & dev team.


GOOD LUCK! :)
